AWS CodeDeploy offers two ways to perform blue/green deployments:

In the first approach, AWS CodeDeploy makes a copy of an Auto Scaling group. It, in turn, provisions new Amazon EC2 instances, deploys the application to these new instances, and then redirects traffic to the newly deployed code.
In the second approach, you use instance tags or an Auto Scaling group to select the instances that will be used for the green environment. AWS CodeDeploy then deploys the code to the tagged instances.
